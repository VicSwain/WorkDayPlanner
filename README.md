# WorkDayPlanner

## Description
This workday planner is designed to color code the time slots as grey for the past, red for the current hour, and green for anything in the future. This planner allows the user to save this tasks via the save button, and will be persit on the page beyond it refershing. The motiviaion of this project is a better understanding of JQuery, dayJS, and JavaScript.  The app is made to help a busy employee keep track of their day and daily ongoings. I have a better understanding of "this" and its usage and what it related to. I also learned more about how to acess and utiize local storage. 

### Usage
User should enter the taske in the desired time slot and use the save button to store the task. Simply input a new task the next day to overwrite the previous task. Green time slots are intended to be future time slots, grey the past, and red being the current hour. 

#### Credits
I pair programmed with Tim Lewis working through this, and had assistance from my tutor Alex Gonzalez starting the project
